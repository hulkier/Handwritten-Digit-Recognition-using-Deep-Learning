# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
Classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0â€“9)

Implementation of a Handwritten Digit Recognizer system using Convolutional Neural Networks for
feature extraction.
- The System was trained on MNIST dataset, 60,000 images of Handwritten Digits, using tools Keras,
Matplotlib
- Achieved an accuracy of 98.7 on the training dataset and 98.9 on the test dataset.
